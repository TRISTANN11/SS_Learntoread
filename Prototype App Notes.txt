NotesSeemed to get through it fine.Asked about how the library works. Harder books lower on the shelf?Wondered if the easy progress bar was progress of all the easy books they’ve done.Liked the trophy case idea.Second tester:	Liked the ease of use and easy controls of the library and reading page. Liked the little instructions on the bottom. Use yellow as a wrong spoken word highlighter. Very easy to navigate. Expand on the bookshelf idea
